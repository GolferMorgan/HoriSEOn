# 01 Code Refactor

## What I did to the Code

In this challenge there were several things that needed to be corrected. To start I removed all unnecessary lines of code from CSS. It was mainly redundant code that I was able to merge into existing code after recognizing the patterns. I also added comments to the CSS allowing me to keep track of the changes I made. After completing the CSS portion I moved to the HTML file. The HTML file had div as the element for everything. I was able to seperate that out and break the code into several different elements with a section for each element. This made the HTML file look much cleaner and give the website more defined lines. The title of the website was also changed from "website" to "HorSEOn." this gave the page and actually title. I was able to make all of the navigation buttons work as well. Each button now leads to the section of the page where that information is located. Finally I adjusted the Footer to give it a designation of "h4" since there was an "h2." The website now functions as it should and has the coding to make it look neat for anyone who comes in behind.
